# Horiseon-Re-work
This project consisted of making a functional website more accessible for people using assistive technologies. 
I used what I've learned so far in class to add alt text to images to facilitate the use of assistive technologies. 
I was able to clean up some redundant parts of code and clean up the look of the index to make it easier for others who may want to work on the page.
